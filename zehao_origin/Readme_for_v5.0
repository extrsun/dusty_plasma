########About ATOMDB version
To switch the ATOMDB version these codes used:
	Step1:change the "version" variable on ****constants.py***** to the version you want.(format '3.0.8')
	Step2:change the version of ATOMDB. 
		you may use the following code in python: 
			import pyatomdb
		 	pyatomdb.util.switch_version('version number') ##format '3.0.8'

Step 0: Run following two script to Generate data packages which will be used by almost every other script
			ionfrac_data.py
			eperionperbin_data.py

Step 1: plot ionic fraction by 
			plot_ionfrac.py

Step 2: plot emissivity curve by
			pltemicurve.py

Step 3: plot Gauss center by
			pltgausscenter.py

Step 4: plot theoretical spectrum by
			pltspec.py

Step 5: Response spectrum with Chandra/Astro-H SXS response file by
		First run
			generate_spec.py
		then run
			plot_response_Chandra
			plot_response_Astro-H

Step 6: plot Astro-H response graph with same y-scale for comparison by
			plot_response_Astro-H_ylim.py

Step 7: Compare the emissivity curve with different ATOMDB version by
		***make sure you have used *ionfrac_data.py* and *eperionperbin_data.py* to generate different versions of data
		First run
			pltemicurve_data.py
		then run
			emicurve_difference.py
